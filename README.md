=============

Programming Language Concepts Projects written in Agda.

"Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language. It has inductive families, i.e., data types which depend on values, such as the type of vectors of a given length. It also has parametrised modules, mixfix operators, Unicode characters, and an interactive Emacs interface which can assist the programmer in writing the program.
Agda is a proof assistant. It is an interactive system for writing and checking proofs. Agda is based on intuitionistic type theory, a foundational system for constructive mathematics developed by the Swedish logician Per Martin-LÃ¶f. It has many similarities with other proof assistants based on dependent types, such as Coq, Epigram, Matita and NuPRL.
Agda is open-source and enjoys contributions from many authors. The center of the Agda development is the Programming Logic group at Chalmers and Gothenburg University; the main developers are Ulf Norell, Nils Anders Danielsson, and Andreas Abel."
